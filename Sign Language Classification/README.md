# Sign language Classification

- **In this project the MNIST data is used**
- **After deviding the data into training and testing, preprocess the data and after reshaping the arrays the data is ready for model making.**
- **The model is build using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)**
- **If we will use hidden layer on NN the accuracy will also improved**
- **Check out the notebook for more clarity**
> - ### Accuracy of the model is - **99.4**
